### September 2022 - November 2022
- [ ] Launch on additional EVM compatible L1's/L2's like Arbitrum, Near, Avalanche, Gnosis Chain, and Fantom, having compatibility with major DEX LP's on each chain.

- [ ] Partnerships/integrations with low-code/no-code DAPP builders for extended reach and exposure.

### December 2022 +
- [ ] Non-custodial, trustless leveraged trading using fully on-chain validation and swap execution
- [ ] Integration of custom TradingView signals to capture institutional/Quant funds that have developed their own internal strategies.
- [ ] A fully on-chain & trustless price oracle that rewards COEX operators for calling the contract to store price history for multiple LP's, which benefits our current users by significantly reducing gas fees, and provides a verifiable on-chain price for other DAPP & DeFi developers.
- [ ] Create an OTC platform for non-custodial, protocol-based transfers between two or more parties on all EVM chains.

*As a note, the above timeline is subject to change depending on if research/development prove lesser/increased difficulty. We are striving for a much sooner timeframe than displayed above.*
