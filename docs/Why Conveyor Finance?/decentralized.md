# 100% Decentralized

Decentralization is a crucial component in DeFi protocols in order to shift the control of a system from one main group (Conveyor Finance) to a system completely controlled by the general public. This gives more power to the individuals by offering a reproducible, predictable, and verifiable method to ensure funds are stored, transacted, and automated in the most efficient and safest way possible.

Conveyor Finance has zero centralized components throughout the process of storing, automating, or transacting tokens for users of our platform. We believe that the foundation of DeFi and any of its systems should not be controlled by any single entity or group of entities. Rather, it should be controlled and operated by the public through verifiable on-chain processes and execution.
