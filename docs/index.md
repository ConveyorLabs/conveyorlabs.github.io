## What is Conveyor? 
Conveyor is a collection of protocols to automate the management of digital cryptocurrency assets for funds, DAO's, whales, and the every day trader. Conveyor specializes in bringing features that are typically available on centralized exchanges (CEX), to the decentralized (DeFi) world. This includes stop losses, take profits and automated trading strategies through on-chain logic, enabling a completely trust-less and decentralized system.

## Who made it?
Conveyor Labs is the for-profit organization that is responsible for the deployment, maintenance, upgrading, and migration of Smart Contracts within the Conveyor Finance ecosystem. Conveyor Labs is owned and operated by DEXbot, a registered LLC in the state of Wyoming, USA. 

## Concept Overview
There are two major parts to the Conveyor ecosystem. The **COEX application** and the **on-chain smart contract**. These two components work together to identify market conditions, validate on-chain LP values, and execute specified swaps autonomously for users of the system. Conveyor takes the centralization or custodial requirements out of swapping tokens so that institutional traders, investment DAOs, token developer teams, and retail traders donâ€™t need to constantly watch charts in anticipation of manually swapping when their desired market conditions are met.
