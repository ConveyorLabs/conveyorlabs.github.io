Lets say that there is another sandbox order waiting to execute, looking to swap 1500 USDC for 1 WETH. The offchain-executor could use the first order to fill the second order, initiating a p2p swap between the two users.","There are also some more exotic ways to fill orders.","Lets say that there is another limit order protocol on the blockchain and they have an active limit order to swap 1500 USDC for 1 WETH. Since the sandbox order's amountIn is transferred optimisitcally, the offchain-executor could create a new limit order on the other protocol, fill the limit order, receiving 1500 USDC and fill the sandbox limit order with the profit, all in one atomic transaction.","Due to the fact that Sandbox orders have no restrictions on how they can fill, orders have the possibility to fill faster and more profitably than current market conditions. Offchain-executors can monitor the chain to close MEV opportunities, and use that profit to fill orders.","Lets use the original example order above, swapping 1 WETH for 1500 USDC to demonstrate this. If current market conditions show that the best exchange rate is 1495 USDC per 1 WETH, but there is an arbitrage opportuntity that would change the price to 1500 USDC per 1 WETH, the off-chain executor could use the order's amountIn(and any other means of liquidity) to close the arbitrage opportunity and fill the sandbox order, all in one atomic transaction. While other traders see the price to be 1495 USDC per 1 WETH, the sandbox limit order filled at 1500 USDC per 1 WETH.","This opens a wide variety of exciting and synergistic possibilites for both traders and MEV searchers alike.","MEV searchers could monitor liquidations, arbitrage opportunties, and any other means of MEV to fill orders. This can also create a cascading affect, where closing an arbitrage opportunity allows the executor to fill a large order, which creates another arbitrage opportunity and so on until all opportunities are exhausted.","Within any of the simplistic or exotic exapmles above, if the full amount can not be filled, the off-chain executor can also partially fill an order as long as they are receiving the order's specified exchange rate for the amount they are paritially filling."]},{"l":"How to Place Sandbox Limit Orders","p":["Placing a sandbox limit order is very similar to placing a stoploss order.

The COEX reward is critically important when considering the possibility of flash loan attacks on the liquidity pools through which the COEX will be executing the transactions. Since the COEX will have visibility over the pending transactions in the queue and know the execution prices of these transactions, it is important to have a mechanistic way of protecting our user base from bad actors in the COEX network. We want to ensure a fair COEX reward for execution while concurrently guaranteeing our user's protection from the possibility of COEXs executing profitable flash loan attacks on liquidity pools to manipulate the spot price to reap the rewards of execution. The COEX reward regarding the fee has been rigorously determined based on principles of conservation functions used in the liquidity pools our users will be interacting with. In order to determine the optimal COEX reward we formulated objective models on the price impact in liquidity pools based on transaction size, formally we determined the relationship between large swap transactions in correspondence with reserve size to determine a formal model of the potential exploitability of the Conveyor Contract from bad actor COEXs on our user base. By analytically determining the relationship between swap size and price impact based on reserve size in the liquidity pools we are able to in real-time calculate the exact threshold amount that a COEX could receive in one execution reward that would make such an attack profitable on the basis of price manipulation in the liquidity pool. We ensure to our user base the unprofitability of such attacks by putting a hard cap on the COEX reward that can be received in one execution to facilitate an ecosystem that rewards playing by the rules."]},{"l":"COEX Reward vs. Conveyor Fee","p":["A user will always pay a fee based on the logistic curve above for each transaction completed.

This higher fee paid to the COEX at higher values offers an increased financial incentive that strengthens the COEX network and entices others to spin up a COEX themselves for a chance of receiving a large reward.","The Below graph illustrates the % of the user fee split between the COEX operator who successfully confirms the transaction, and the Conveyor Labs fee","Purple = User Fee - Orange = Conveyor's Share - Green = COEXs Share","The above graph implements the following fee calculation reserved for Conveyor Labs - Orange","and the fee structure reserved for the COEX that successfully executed the transaction - Green","When both the orange and green logistic curves are combined, they result in the purple line, which is the total fee the user pays once their order is executed. The benefit of implementing a crossover in reward allocation is that COEXs who confirm higher value transactions receive a higher proportion of the fee, while lower transactions benefit Conveyor Labs for future developments of the ecosystem. Custom COEX applications can be custom developed by software developers that only focus on higher-value transactions, while other COEX applications can be focused on smaller, more frequent trades.

Traditional DeFi automation networks such as The Gelato Network have an internal executor network to call the execution functions of the on-chain logic. The Conveyor COEX network is completely democratized, allowing anyone to spin up a COEX client and start executing incoming orders in the queue. The reason why most other well-known DeFi automation protocols keep their executor network internal is because of the risk of bad actors in the COEX network. Since the COEX network will be reaping the rewards of execution on the transactions in the queue, it is possible for a COEX to manipulate the spot price in a liquidity pool to drive the price to the execution trigger for a batch of transactions to execute, in such cases where the execution reward is significantly large.","The Conveyor protocol has deeply analyzed this problem, and mathematically formulated a model on when such an attack will be profitable. Our protocol's COEX reward is analytically determined with flash loan attacks in mind and is hard-capped at the exact value that would make such an attack profitable. Meaning, a COEX could take out a flash loan to manipulate the price of an lp to the execution trigger for a batch of transactions and at best will be breaking even - the gas accumulated in the transaction. Alternatively, the COEX could simply play by the rules and reap the max execution reward getting a net-positive return.","The overall philosophy of the Conveyor protocol has been to mechanistically design the system in such a way that the most profitable way to use the platform is also the correct way to use the platform, and flash loan attack prevention has been mechanistically designed into the system to be unprofitable so attempting such attacks will invariably lose money for bad actors in the network."]},{"l":"Contract Security","p":["The conveyor contract has been designed with security as the top priority. Our engineers have designed a custom EOA library to further strengthen the security of our execution function from external contract calls. This library protects against sophisticated ghost contract calls which several modern protocols which only check the code size of the caller are still vulnerable to. The Conveyor contract will be audited by QuantStamp prior to our protocol launch to ensure a deep level of security and professional oversight to our userbase.","Although we have made deep mechanistic design decisions to prevent flash loan attacks on the liquidity pools to trigger order executions. We further implement price oracles as secondary price indicators alongside the liquidity pool spot prices based on reserve size. This is to have redundancy in our execution price triggers in order to prevent execution on a manipulated spot price in a liquidity pool. For example, if a user on our platform places a limit sell order and a bad actor takes out a flash loan in the respective lp to depreciate the spot price to the execution trigger. Our contract will not execute as the oracle price will conflict with the liquidity pool price. So, our userbase can feel safer when trading in volatile liquidity pools that their orders will not execute on atomic manipulated price data in the liquidity pools."]}],[{"l":"Smart Contracts"},{"l":"Ethereum","p":["Contract Name","Contract Address","Conveyor Executor","0x91AE75251Bc0c6654EF0B327D190877B49b21A2E","Limit Order Router","0xCd1BA99aF51CcFcffdEa7F466D6A8D5AF81c5e6E","Sandbox Limit Order Book","0x0c9C4CC14E0C487ef44fA23630A69A06b8b75A91","Sandbox Limit Order Router","0x6d53e6b2c079a98fC0F736dFdE348278FDc91629","Limit Order Quoter","0xb663b9804540539c956aeFFf64bAfC19aDbc5e23","Conveyor Swap Aggregator","0x6DBEd6b5aeD3b4CD0A0B72c6E3ee7583C1205835"]},{"l":"BNB Chain","p":["Contract Name","Contract Address","Conveyor Executor","0x902c9e3202F5191db0B6edF5c038F4941Dfd6641","Limit Order Router","0x400966bC4ab862C2094d6d749DB0C42b66605F4A","Sandbox Limit Order Book","0x4dCdBa96dc7244baa763eC51Ca0dBcDddBCee4e7","Sandbox Limit Order Router","0x456f041CA2f3964bD07AB9FE20e2A0607F04615C","Limit Order Quoter","0xB5d29EbE6AEA9c39027FA2d2981c816E21356362","Conveyor Swap Aggregator","0x7bfd65463747A2B375a6C376761d054840f49e7D"]},{"l":"Polygon","p":["Contract Name","Contract Address","Conveyor Executor","0x6d53e6b2c079a98fC0F736dFdE348278FDc91629","Limit Order Router","0xDe160A8fb9eB7bd2309E5470D9F0dB3Fc6C99E78","Sandbox Limit Order Book","0x87b6Ba07aAB69AF8f91cc7372bBF589e28F5219d","Sandbox Limit Order Router","0xe56B8CF0aB1865Dd0C9A1c81C076D2843Eb90B97","Limit Order Quoter","0x0c9C4CC14E0C487ef44fA23630A69A06b8b75A91","Conveyor Swap Aggregator","0x2620430fe83D963AE3063faD3EAEeeaDe9262dFF"]},{"l":"Arbitrum","p":["Contract Name","Contract Address","Conveyor Executor","0xe56B8CF0aB1865Dd0C9A1c81C076D2843Eb90B97","Limit Order Router","0xf88F7Ebba40674Ce4364a048f6A72367979B7274","Sandbox Limit Order Book","0xAAb2e639AaacE78047990B621aD939d4D73680De","Sandbox Limit Order Router","0xb463F64b4C9cff579b9C2935b702536764F7F8c6","Limit Order Quoter","0x87b6Ba07aAB69AF8f91cc7372bBF589e28F5219d","Conveyor Swap Aggregator","0x42538b6BF267646a9dD32789D526386666a6765B"]}],[{"l":"The COEX Network"},{"l":"Overview","p":["Conveyor Finance is innovating DeFi automation in that the on-chain functions that execute users' automated swaps are publicly callable by anyone.

Each COEX in the network monitors on-chain state changes in Conveyor contracts, receiving a reward for each transaction that it successfully completes. The Conveyor ecosystem is fully permissionless, meaning that COEXs compete amongst each other to execute transactions faster than their peers, which ensures that orders are guaranteed and executed as fast as possible. Through the COEX network, Conveyor is able to enable trustless, fully decentralized contract automation for decentralized finance.","The COEX interacts with the public functions of our protocols in order to execute automated swap transactions for our users.

All order execution is verified on-chain, meaning that a limit order will only execute when the price, order quantity, and all other necessary conditions are met on chain (conditions for order execution are discussed in detail in the Limit Orders section of the whitepaper). COEXs listen for events emitted from the Limit Order contract to update their local state whenever any order is placed, updated, canceled, or executed. When an active limit order hits its execution price, COEXs race to call the contract, with a reward going to the COEX that successfully completes the transaction. This creates a financial incentive to support the Conveyor system, which ensures competition throughout the COEX network.
