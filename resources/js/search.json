It then sorts each route by which provides the most favorable output (output value - gas), and calculates the difference in gas saved. The results is a swap that leverages the same routes, LP interactions, and splits as 1inch and Paraswap, with the added benefit of being upwards of 50% cheaper than executing the swap through them directly."]}],[{"l":"Conveyor API Developer Docs","p":["The Conveyor API allows users to fetch optimal swap routes from one token to another along with executable transaction data.

This encompasses nearly every major DEX launched in the last few years, including Sushiswap, PancakeSwap, Camelot, Trader Joe, and several others. We plan to support several other DeFi protocols in the future including Curve, Balancer, Aave, etc."]},{"i":"why-use-conveyors-aggregator","l":"Why Use Conveyor's Aggregator?","p":["Other DEX's and aggregators utilize a specific smart contract called a Router that communicates between various liquidity pools for both single and multi LP interactions. While this does improve the likelyhood that a transaction will be successful, all of this processing is executed on-chain with multiple external contract calls and transfers in order to work.","With Conveyor, we construct all transaction calldata off-chain in a much more effective and cost-efficient manner, and pass the most favorable swap data back to the frontend for the trader to sign with their connected wallet.","This reduces unnecessary external calls or token transfers, which reduces the amount of on-chain processing needed to perform the swap, resulting in a much more gas efficient swap.","All calldata is send and received from our API, which syncs with all v2/v3 based pool for each chain Conveyor is deployed to."]},{"i":"how-other-dexsaggregators-handle-transactions","l":"How other DEX's/Aggregators handle transactions"},{"l":"How Conveyor handles transactions"}],[{"l":"Fee Structure","p":["Conveyor charges a fee based on how much gas we can save you when executing the swap. A fee of 50% of the gas savings is applied only when when gas saved 0.","For example, if a swap of ETH > USDC costs $20 through 1inch on Ethereum Mainnet and Conveyor provides the exact same swap outcome for only $10, a $5 worth of Ether fee is applied. This essentially provides a 25% gas discount to the trader for the same swap compared to 1inch.","The fee is paid via the msg.value of the submitted transaction data for Token <> Token swaps, and Token > ETH swaps. For Eth > token swaps, the protocol fee is added to the msg.value of the transaction amount, so a swap of 1 ETH > USDC with a .00015 protocol fee would have a msg.value of 1.00015 sent from the users wallet to execute the swap and pay the protocol fee."]},{"l":"How gas is calculated","p":["Both 1inch and Paraswap, our aggregator partners, return a gas estimation in their API response, along with the route data. After decoding their routes and reconstructing the swap calldata, we estimate gas on our end as well. This accuracy is further enhanced once you have given the ConveyorRouterV1 token approval for the quantity you want to swap, and is within +-200 gas (0.08% accuracy deviance) from the actual transaction once submitted."]}],[{"l":"Introduction","p":["Conveyor offers a referral reward to those who refer others to perform swaps using Conveyor. This referral reward is sent to the referrer when the referred wallet performs any swap through the Conveyor ecosystem. The reward is sent atomically at the time of the swap, and there is no need to collect your rewards via a dashboard or withdraw function"]},{"l":"How it works","p":["Any wallet can become a referrer by signing a transaction that stores their wallet address to the ConveyorRouterV1. This can be done simply through the Conveyor Trading App. The motivation for this method is to save on gas fees when performing the transaction where a referrer qualifies to receive rewards.","In order to receive rewards, you must write your address to each chain that you'd like to receive rewards for. When a referred user perform a swaps on each chain, the Conveyor website checks to see if the referred user visits the site using a referrer URL (eg. https://app.conveyor.finance/?ref=9393e). It then looks up any addresses of the referrer user based on the ?ref= value. and passes the referralID to the Conveyor API if the user performing the swap is on a chain that the referrer has stored their address in the ConveyorRouterV1 address","Once a referred user connects their wallet to the website using your referral URL, their wallet is stored to our database as a referred user to you, and they no longer need to access the site via your referral URL in order for you to continue to receive rewards for each swap they perform."]},{"l":"Buttons","p":["Earn Rewards- This button means your wallet provider is on the same network that correlates with the Chain Name. Pressing this button brings up a transaction for you to sign that stores your wallet address to that chain so you can begin receiving rewards","Earning Rewards- This button means that you are currently receiving rewards for that chain, and that any referred users that perform a swap using your referral URL on that chain will grant you rewards.","Switch Network- This button means your wallet provider is not on the same network that correlates with the Chain Name, and that you aren't currently receiving rewards on that chain. Pressing this button brings requests your wallet provider to switch network. After switching, the button will change to Earn Rewards"]},{"l":"Referral Link","p":["Once you write your wallet address to at least one chain, you will be issued a referral reward with a referral reference ID. This URL is linked to the wallet you used when writing to the first chain and will stay the same through out the lifecycle of the wallet. This referral identifier cannot be changed, as it is derrived from a hash of your wallet.","In order for you to receive credit as the referrer of a referred user, they must connect their wallet in the same session as visiting your referral URL. If they revisit the site without your referral ID before first connecting their wallet, they will need to revisit the site using your referral URL again in order for you to receive credit as their referrer."]}],[{"l":"Smart Contracts","p":["All our smart contracts have the same deterministic address, but we've broken down each chain to include links to our verified addresses","Contract Name","Contract Address","Etherscan Link","ConveyorRouterV1","0x3642189b7754302df84b6f3fe1ae34d2026647a7","Link","ConveyorMulticall","0x0f98Dd99A444E100E56B56D4B99c8b623C091B2f","Polygonscan link","BscScan Link","Arbiscan Link"]}]]
